## Why do we need to give names to events, effects and etc ?
This will help in the future, in the development of the Effector DevTools, and now it is used in the [Playground](https://effector.now.sh/try) on the left sidebar.  
If you don't want to do it, you can use the [Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effector/babel-plugin). It will automatically generate the name for events and effects from the variable name.
